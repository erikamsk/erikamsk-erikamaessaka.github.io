                <div class="disclaimer">
                    <p class="asterisk">*</p><p>Academic project created in collaboration with Ana Marta Souza, Gonçalo Marques and Teresa Fernandes (2022).</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>...was to propose a new feature for an existing product (following its logic and brand's visual identity), through lean UX methodologies and agile product development principles of our choice, defining and developing our own process.</p>
                    <h3>Our Starting Point</h3>
                    <p>We decided to tackle the out-of-hours emails issue, which has become more relevant as more people switched to remote work due to the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving the line between personal and professional life becoming even more blurred, with studies showing the harmful impact it has on our physical and emotional health.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>With this in mind, we thought of a feature that would prevent these emails to be seen or even arrive on the user's inbox within a specified timeframe. This initial idea would then become the Closed Inbox.</p>
                    

                    <h3>The Process</h3>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="assets/gmail-process.jpg" alt="four lines with google's colours to represent each stage. below a list of all methods used during each phase.">
                        <figcaption>Fig. #1 - Process divided in four stages based on the double diamond approach.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h3>Discovery</h3>

                    <h4>Desk Research and Benchmark</h4>
                    <p>We confirmed our assumption that out of hours communication is a present issue and is taking a toll on workers’ mental health and their work satisfaction. What’s more, we found out that, due to financial insecurity from the pandemic, workers feel even less capable of acting in these situations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We also looked into apps like Blacklist and SMS Blocker and features such as “do not disturb” from Samsung, Iphone’s “Focus Mode” and Outlooks’ inbox. Their notification blocking system was based either on the sender or the app where the notification was coming from, giving us some base ideas for our feature.</p>

                    <h4>Gmail Analysis</h4>
                    <p>We listed some current Gmail’s features which could possibly be a starting point for our project: they gave us a clear idea of the app’s workflow, its tools and its weaknesses. With this knowledge we would be able to discuss with users about their email management strategies, and possibly integrate some of the already existing features with our own.</p>

                    <h4>Assumptions, Survey & Interviews</h4>
                    <p>On top of the preliminary research, we used an Assumptions Matrix to identify what we should investigate further, those being, the ones that we didn’t have enough information on and were crucial for the project:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>→ Do users know how to use more beyond the basic features on Gmail?</i></p>
                    <p><i>→ Do users use Gmail as their main work communication channel?</i></p>
                    <p><i>→ Do users want to disconnect because they feel overwhelmed?</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Based on these three questions, we performed interviews with participants that answered our survey. One of the most interesting outcomes was how excessive work communication is harmful not only out of hours but while working as well, as emails distract and disrupt focus and productivity.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="assets/gmail-interview.png" alt="Sticky notes with notes from our interviews with Gmail Users">
                        <figcaption>Fig #2 - Interview Analysis. We categorised users according to their level of anxiety over out-of-hours emails.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>The ones that didn’t express anxiety around out-of-hour communications because they actually didn’t even see them; they used strategies to block emails or help them ignore work communication at certain times.</p>

                    <h3>Development</h3>

                    <h4>User Profiles & User Journey</h4>
                    <p>We divided our users in 4 groups through a matrix of 2 axis: Relaxed — Anxious, and Runners — Punching bags. We set our target audience as the “Anxious Punching Bags”, those that feel stressed with excessive or out-of-hours communication and do not have strategies to block them, taking tasks on as soon as they fall into their inbox. Additionally, we also took into consideration the group of the “Anxious Runners”, analysing their strategies to build a foundation concept of what our feature could do.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We built our customer journey based on the interviews we conducted, the articles we read and our own experience. We simulated a typical work day of our user’s life, which helped us to identify the pain points and necessities of the journey.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="assets/gmail-userjourney.png" alt="User journey with activites, emotions, pain points and necessities through the day">

                    </figure>

                    <h4>How Might We & Affinity Map</h4>
                    <p>With our user journey and our target group established we constructed our HMW questions, coming down to three: How might we help anxious punching bags</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>...to concentrate and prioritise the task in hand?</i></p>
                    <p><i>...to not feel overwhelmed with the anticipation of future tasks?</i></p>
                    <p><i>...to feel less guilty for not responding to work requests immediately?</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>From there we brainstormed possible solutions using an Affinity Map. A multitude of them came up, ranging from very simple notification-level features, to complex interfaces that could be integrated into the already existing one.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="assets/gmail-affinity.jpg" alt="on the left a list with names of the idea clusters and on the right a few stickynotes with ideas from the brainstorm.">
                        <figcaption>Fig. #4 - Affinity Map. We started with 3min brainstorm rounds for each HMW. Then, we cluster the ideas by similarity and voted for the ones we would like to work with.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h3>Creation</h3>

                    <h4>Sketching, Wireframing and Prototyping</h4>
                    <p>At first the sketches worked as a brainstorming tool to generate ideas. But as the discussion progressed, we ended up doing many in-between sketches with annotations, combining ideas and trying to explain to each other the user flows we imagined in our heads. It was a long process, but it helped us a lot to find a solution that answered our questions, worked and was simple for users to navigate.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once we got to a consensus, we created a rather unusual wireframe, but that worked to materialise the concept for everyone and define the main user flow.</p>

                    <h3>The Product</h3>
                    <h4>Closed Inbox</h4>
                    <p>With Closed Inbox, you can choose what enters your inbox and when. Silence emails for a set period of time based on criteria such as labels or senders. Simply create a mode, choose what is blocked and for how long and work in peace.</p>

                    <h3>Testing</h3>

                    <h4>User Testing and Results</h4>
                    <p>Lastly, we outlined our goals and tasks and recruited participants for the usability tests. We ran tests using the desktop interface as in our interviews we noticed most people prefer it for work. The Gmail mobile app is very limited as well, and doesn’t have important functionalities like creating and editing labels.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The results very were successful: users didn't notice the new feature on Gmail's interface right away, but once they did they understood the concept quickly and perfomed all tasks easily.Most mistakes occurred in the second task, mostly due to the components' clickable area, which was too small. Also, some users had difficulty finding the “Mode settings” menu and ended up clicking elsewhere to edit the mode.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="assets/gmail-tests.png" alt="Usability tests' results for every task. The less sucessful one, task n.2, had 7/10 participants that completed it successfully, 2/10 partially and 1/10 that failed.">
                        <figcaption>Fig. #11 - Usability tests' results per task.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <ul class="body-list">
                        <li>⚫ - User completed task easily</li>
                        <li>◑ - User completed the task with bit difficulty</li>
                        <li>◯ - User failed completing the task</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overall, participants’ reviews were very positive and many thought the feature was very useful and that it should be implemented into Gmail.  ●</p>

                    <h3>For the future</h3>
                    <h4>Develop Mobile Version</h4>
                    <p>The mobile version lacks the ability to create and edit labels. We would redesign the app to be able to have these same features for the closed inbox.</p>

                    <h4>Create “Add words” feature to block list</h4>
                    <p>Just like you can block tags and people, initially we wanted to block selected words as well but had to cut this feature in order to not over complicate.</p>

                    <h4>First time tutorial</h4>
                    <p>For the first time the user opens Gmail with the Closed Inbox feature, we feel the need for a optional tutorial to guide the user through the feature. ●</p>
